when i was younger and i would told the people what i want to do,
they did always answer in the same way laughing to me.
that is because i always was thin.

but, what did i want to do,
and why the people did laughing to me because i chose that.

if fact i tried to do the examn twice. 

and i never failed in the things which the people didn´t trust on me,
